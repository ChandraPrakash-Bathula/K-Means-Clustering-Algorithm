# K-Means Clustering Algorithm

This project provides an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm using Python and the `scikit-learn` library. K-Means is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering data into a predefined number of clusters. This example demonstrates the application of K-Means to a synthetic dataset and includes visualization of clustering results in 2D and 3D.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**: Creation of a synthetic dataset suitable for clustering analysis.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Application of the K-Means algorithm with customization options for the number of clusters and initialization methods.
- **Visualization**: 2D and 3D visualization of clustering results using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction.
- **Interactive Analysis**: Code structured to easily modify parameters and visualize different outcomes.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

You can install these with pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

The project is structured into several Jupyter Notebook cells, which include:

1. **Data Setup**: Configure the synthetic dataset.
2. **K-Means Implementation**: Apply the K-Means algorithm to the dataset.
3. **2D Visualization**: Reduce dimensionality to two dimensions using PCA and visualize the results.
4. **3D Visualization**: Reduce dimensionality to three dimensions for a different perspective.

### Running the Code

Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially to observe how the K-Means algorithm clusters the dataset. Modify the `n_clusters` parameter in the KMeans function call to experiment with different numbers of clusters.

## Example Output

After running the notebook, you will see scatter plots showing the data points colored according to the cluster they belong to, with cluster centers marked in red.
